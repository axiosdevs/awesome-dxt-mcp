## 🤔 What is DXT & MCP?

**Desktop Extensions (DXT)** are a packaging format introduced by Anthropic in June 2025 that makes installing MCP servers as simple as clicking a button. They bundle entire MCP servers with all dependencies into a single `.dxt` file.

**Model Context Protocol (MCP)** is an open-source protocol that enables AI applications like Claude Desktop to securely connect with local and remote resources.

### Key Benefits:
- ✅ **One-click installation** - No terminal or developer tools required
- 🔒 **Secure by design** - Sensitive data stays in OS keychain
- 🔄 **Automatic updates** - Extensions update seamlessly
- 🎯 **Local-first** - Your data never leaves your machine
- 🛠️ **Cross-platform** - Works on Windows, macOS, and Linux
- 📦 **Dependency-free** - All requirements bundled together

---

## 🚀 Getting Started

### For Users
1. **Download Claude Desktop** - Get the latest version from [claude.ai](https://claude.ai/download)
2. **Browse Extensions** - Find extensions in this list or Claude's built-in directory
3. **Install with One Click** - Download `.dxt` files and double-click to install
4. **Configure & Use** - Follow the setup prompts and start automating

### For Developers
```bash
# Install the official DXT CLI
npm install -g @anthropic-ai/dxt

# Initialize a new extension
dxt init

# Package your extension
dxt pack

# Validate your extension
dxt validate
```
